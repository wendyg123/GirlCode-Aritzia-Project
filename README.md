# GirlCode x Aritzia Project: Style Your Aritzia

‘Style Your Aritzia’ is a project that focuses on creating one’s outfits with Aritzia products to cater to one’s specific personal skin tone and body type. This platform allows one to share their outfits designed online and be inspired by others on a social media “like” page. This page would continuously recommend posts that are similar to ones the user has liked. Such a page would allow large amounts of data to be collected on the customers of Aritzia based on what posts they decide to like and also whether they make a purchase of an item seen on someone else’s post. This creates an engaging hyper-personalized experience for online customers, constantly exposing them to new Aritzia products specifically catered for them. Each piece of Aritzia item added to a customer’s personal Aritzia closet helps Artizia analyze their aesthetics, thereby recommending similar styles and most frequently brought itemset to this customer. This aims to help Aritzia’s loyal and new customers to be free and wild with their style at no cost.
